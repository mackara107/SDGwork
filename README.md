# SDGwork
Programs used for extracting Article Titles and Abstracts for journals that will eventually be given the SDG Impact Intensityâ„¢ rating based on the journal's compliance with the SDGs.

# Crossref.ipynb
This program uses Crossref to extract the article titles and abstracts. All that is needed is the Journal's ISSN and then the results will go to a CSV file.

# All others
All others are specific to the publishers website and require a URL to the specific journal on the website. All of the journal's articles and titles will go to a CSV file from there.
